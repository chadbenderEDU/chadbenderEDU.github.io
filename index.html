                        <p>There's no way to say all of this without sounding preachy, so just try to keep in mind we are not under the impression that we are better than anyone. In fact all of our artists generally have something to sell at live shows, whether it be limited edition vinyl or a t-shirt. We are just trying to do something different because different = fun. Quote Unquote Records is a donation-based record label. We have simple goals which is to put out good music, put out fun music and help our artists get heard. Record labels are failing miserably right now, and I'm pretty sure that is because they are trying to sell CDs. Aside from maybe the latest NOW compilations and that Red Hot Chili Peppers double disc (that was a shocker!), CD sales ain't doin' so hot. That's because people just download it anyway.<br><br>
While some people who are very uncomfortable with embracing a new technology swear that this is going to kill rock and roll, I have seen first hand that it helps bands increase their audience and allows fans to discover tons of great bands. Then, usually at a show, people will buy a CD or something if the band is really good.
<br><br>
If you are diggin' what we're doing, please toss us some money so we can continue to grow and maybe start something new. I mean seriously, a million labels selling CDs, there's gotta be one that's giving them away, right? To download our catalog, click on the little albums link on the left and if you like an artist, please donate the suggested price. Even though we all try to record these albums on our own, your donations help us to eat on tour, pay for promotion and hopefully one day, allow us to do some cool stuff that "real" bands with "labels" do - like recording and packaging records. Fuck, with your help, maybe we can even change this stupid stupid underground music industry from fashionista indie labels back to friendly songwriters and nerds.
<br>Thanks a lot for stopping by. Hope you enjoy.</p>
